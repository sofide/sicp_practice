# SICP Practice

This repo is my playground to experiment, practice, and solve some some exercises from the book
"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"

The examples are written in [Scheme](https://www.scheme.org/) (Lisp) and can be executed online
here: https://try.scheme.org/

You can also try them out locally (if you have scheme isntalled in your computer):
- Run the script with `scheme  < <file_path.scm>`
- Load the script in an interactive scheme shell with: `(load "<file_path.scm>")`
